I’m currently pursuing my M.Sc. at McGill University, where I work under the guidance of Professor Tal Arbel in the Probabilistic Vision Group ([PVG](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~pvg/)). My research delves into cutting-edge deep-learning techniques, specifically focusing on leveraging GANs and diffusion models to advance medical imaging. Recently, I embarked on an exciting journey as a Visiting Researcher at ServiceNow in Montreal. Here, my focus has shifted towards Diffusion Language Modeling, particularly through the use of Masked Discrete Diffusions—a field that holds immense potential for the future of AI-driven communication.

Feel free to reach out if you share an interest in these areas, or want to chat about how these technologies can reshape industries!
