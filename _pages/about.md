I’m currently pursuing my M.Sc. at McGill University, where I work under the guidance of Professor Tal Arbel in the Probabilistic Vision Group ([PVG](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~pvg/)). My research delves into cutting-edge deep-learning techniques, specifically focusing on leveraging GANs and diffusion models to advance medical imaging. Recently, I embarked on an exciting journey as a Visiting Researcher at ServiceNow in Montreal. Here, my focus has shifted towards Diffusion Language Modeling, particularly through the use of Masked Discrete Diffusions—a field that holds immense potential for the future of AI-driven communication.

I’m a Research Scientist at ([MILA](https://mila.quebec/en)) (Quebec AI Institute), where I design and build multi-agent, multi-modal AI systems for healthcare. My day-to-day work centers on creating interconnected agents that can analyze medical images, generate clinical narratives, answer diagnostic queries, and propose counterfactual explanations—all within a unified, scalable framework.

I began my journey at Sharif University of Technology, earning a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering in 2017. Drawn to the challenge of medical image analysis, I pursued an M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University under ([Prof. Tal Arbel](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/tal-arbel)) in the Probabilistic Vision Group. There, I explored GANs, diffusion models, and 3D foundational architectures, laying the groundwork for explainable generative AI in medicine.

Following my master’s, I joined ([ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/)) in Montreal as a Visiting Researcher and collaborated with ([Pierre-André Noël](https://www.servicenow.com/research/author/pierre-andre-noel.html)). I led the development of one of the first large-scale discrete diffusion language models, building an open-source framework capable of training and running at the billion-parameter scale. Through that work, I demonstrated how diffusion-based text generators can deliver 10–20× faster output than traditional autoregressive models without compromising quality—opening new possibilities for both cloud-based services and on-device applications.

Outside of work, when I am not tinkering with science, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, playing video games, and hanging out with friends and family.
