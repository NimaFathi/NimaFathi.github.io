<p><strong>About Me:</strong> I’m Nima Fathi, a deep-learning researcher with an M.Sc. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from McGill/Mila (supervised by Prof. Tal Arbel). My work sits at the intersection of computer vision and NLP—advancing medical-imaging AI with GANs and diffusion models, and pioneering diffusion language models via masked discrete diffusions as a Visiting Researcher at ServiceNow. Previously, I designed and scaled ML systems in industry (Divar, Yektanet) and have first-author publications at ICLR, COLM, MIDL, and MICCAI. I thrive on translating cutting-edge research into production-grade AI solutions.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences in the world of technology and research. I'm particularly excited to share insights from my work at ServiceNow in Montreal, where I've been focusing on Diffusion Language Modeling through Masked Discrete Diffusions.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>

<p>My current research interests include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in medical imaging</li>
  <li>Diffusion models for image generation and analysis</li>
  <li>Diffusion Language Modeling</li>
  <li>Masked Discrete Diffusions</li>
</ul>
